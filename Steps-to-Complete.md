# Goal
To create a single-page MERN stack application. 

# How to Set Up the Repo
- [ ] create a repository on Github and set permissions to protect the main branch (refer to `06-Server-Side-APIs/01-Activities/25-Stu_Git-Repo-Setup` if you need a refresher on how to do this)
- [ ] initialize the repository as `Node` application - (run `npm init -y`)
- [ ] run `npx create-react-app client` to create the `client` folder in the repository
- [ ] create a `server` folder in the repository
- [ ] refer to an example from class (Unit 21 mini-project is a good one) for what folders and files will be needed in `server`
